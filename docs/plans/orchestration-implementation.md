# Orchestration Implementation Plan

**Status:** In Progress — Solution identified (use `qwen` CLI directly)

**Created:** 2026-02-20
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-20 (discovered `qwen` CLI supports `--session-id`)

---

## Objective

Create a script-driven multi-agent orchestration system for the Jaggers Agent Tools ecosystem that replaces fragile `-r latest` session resumption with **UUID-pinned sessions**.

### Problem Being Solved

Current orchestration skills (`orchestrating-agents`, `delegating`) use natural language prompts and rely on `-r latest` / `-c` for session resumption. This is fragile because:

1. **`-r latest` is global** — If you start another Gemini session in a parallel terminal, `-r latest` resumes the wrong one
2. **No session tracking** — No persistent record of which session belongs to which workflow turn
3. **Manual prompt stitching** — Claude must manually pipe output between agents (token-inefficient)
4. **Shell parallelism doesn't work** — Backgrounding CLI processes (`gemini ... &`) loses output association

### Proposed Solution

A Node.js script (`cli/lib/orchestrate.js` or test equivalent) that:

1. **Pins Gemini sessions** — Diff `--list-sessions` before/after Turn 1 → extract new UUID
2. **Pins CCS sessions** — Pre-generate UUID → pass `--session-id` upfront
3. **Stores workflow state** — `.jaggers/sessions.json` registry with pinned UUIDs
4. **Handoffs via files** — `.jaggers/handover/turn_N_<id>.md` artifacts instead of string piping
5. **Resumes deterministically** — `-r <uuid>` (Gemini) / `--resume <uuid>` (CCS) instead of `-r latest`

---

## What Was Done

### 1. Architectural Analysis (3-turn collaborative session)

Ran a collaborative workflow between Claude (controller), Gemini, and Qwen to evaluate parallel execution strategies:

| Strategy | Verdict |
|----------|---------|
| Shell parallelism (`gemini ... & qwen ...`) | ❌ No structured output capture, race conditions |
| Sub-agent delegation (Claude `Task` tool) | ✅ Good for independent tasks, no iterative refinement |
| Hybrid orchestration (script-driven) | ✅ Best for multi-turn handshaking |

**Conclusion**: Script-driven orchestration with UUID-pinned sessions is the correct approach.

### 2. Test Skill Created

**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/orchestrate-test/`

```
orchestrate-test/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    └── orchestrate.mjs
```

**Skill definition**: Instructs Claude to invoke the script for testing collaborative/adversarial workflows.

### 3. Orchestration Script Implemented

**Location**: `~/.claude/skills/orchestrate-test/scripts/orchestrate.mjs`

**Core mechanics**:

```js
// Gemini: diff --list-sessions before/after Turn 1
const before = listGeminiSessions()  // Extract all UUIDs
const output = run('gemini', ['-p', prompt])
const after = listGeminiSessions()
const geminiUUID = findNewUUID(before, after)  // Pin this!

// CCS: pre-generate UUID
const ccsId = randomUUID()
run('ccs', ['qwen', '-p', '--session-id', ccsId, prompt])

// Resume: use pinned UUID (not "latest")
run('gemini', ['-r', geminiUUID, '-p', refinementPrompt])
```

**Artifacts produced**:

```
.jaggers/
  sessions.json              ← { workflow_id: { gemini_session: uuid, ccs_session: uuid, ... } }
  handover/
    turn_1_<id>.md           ← Gemini proposal
    turn_2_<id>.md           ← CCS critique
    turn_3_<id>.md           ← Gemini synthesis
```

### 4. Session Pinning Validated

**Gemini** — Tested and confirmed working:

```
# Before Turn 1
gemini --list-sessions  # 22 sessions

# Run Turn 1
gemini -p "Propose a solution..."
# New session created

# After Turn 1
gemini --list-sessions  # 23 sessions
# Diff → extract UUID: 343336f7-a201-4511-a53e-990eb7091cc1

# Resume (pinned)
gemini -r 343336f7-a201-4511-a53e-990eb7091cc1 -p "Refine..."
# ✅ Works — immune to parallel sessions
```

**Qwen** — Direct CLI works, discovered `--session-id` support:

```
# ✅ Tested and working:
qwen -p --session-id "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000" "Say hello"
# Output: "Hello! I'm ready to help you with your projects..."

# ✅ Resume works (but interactive picker only):
qwen -r  # Shows session picker, not scriptable

# ❌ No --list-sessions equivalent
# ❌ Resume by UUID non-interactively not available
```

**Key difference from Gemini**:
- `qwen --session-id <uuid>` creates a session with that ID (pre-generation works ✅)
- `qwen -r` shows interactive picker (no `-r <uuid>` direct resume like Gemini)
- No `--list-sessions` to discover session IDs after creation

**Workaround**: In collaborative workflow, Qwen is Turn 2 only (critique), so no resume needed. Pre-generating UUID for `--session-id` is sufficient.

---

## Solution Found

### Use `qwen` CLI directly, not `ccs qwen`

**Discovery**: The original `orchestrating-agents` skill used `qwen` directly. We mistakenly went through `ccs` wrapper.

**Why `ccs qwen` was hanging**:
- `ccs` wraps `claude` binary which has TTY requirements and nested-session checks
- Even with `CLAUDECODE=""` unset, the underlying `claude` process was waiting for something
- `ccs` is designed for interactive use, not headless script execution

**Why `qwen` direct works**:
- Native CLI, no wrapping
- `--session-id <uuid>` flag supports pre-generated UUIDs
- `-p` flag works headlessly without TTY
- No nested-session restrictions

**Updated script approach**:

```js
// Turn 2: Use qwen directly
const qwenId = randomUUID()
run('qwen', ['-p', '--session-id', qwenId, critiquePrompt])
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate

1. **Update script to use `qwen` directly** — Replace `ccs qwen` with `qwen`
2. **Test full 3-turn workflow** — Verify collaborative works end-to-end
3. ~~**Consider AWS cli-agent-orchestrator**~~ — ✅ Completed, see [aws-cao-integration-analysis.md](aws-cao-integration-analysis.md)

### AWS CAO Analysis Summary

**Conclusion:** Improve Jaggers with CAO-inspired features rather than full adoption.

Key findings:
- CAO is tmux-based with HTTP API control; Jaggers is file-based with direct CLI invocation
- CAO lacks Gemini/Qwen support (optimized for Amazon Q CLI, Claude Code)
- Features to adopt: status detection, async "Assign" mode, HTTP API layer
- File-based handover remains superior for human readability and version control

See full analysis: [aws-cao-integration-analysis.md](aws-cao-integration-analysis.md)

### Implementation path

1. **Fix the script** — Ensure `ccs qwen` (or alternative) produces output
2. **Test full workflow** — Run 3-turn collaborative end-to-end
3. **Add more workflows** — Adversarial, troubleshoot, handshake
4. **Move to project CLI** — Promote from `~/.claude/skills/` to `cli/lib/orchestrate.js`
5. **Update skills** — Modify `orchestrating-agents` to invoke script instead of natural language prompts
6. **Document** — Update `docs/` with new architecture

## Related Research: AWS CLI Agent Orchestrator

**Project**: [awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator](https://github.com/awslabs/cli-agent-orchestrator)

### Key Architectural Concepts

| Component | Description | Relevance to Jaggers |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| **tmux sessions** | Each agent runs in isolated tmux session | More robust than our simple script; enables true parallelism |
| **MCP server** | Model Context Protocol for agent communication | Could replace file-based handoffs |
| **CAO_TERMINAL_ID** | Unique ID per terminal for routing | Similar to our UUID pinning but with runtime routing |
| **REST API** | `/sessions`, `/sessions/{id}/terminals` endpoints | Enables programmatic session management |
| **Database state** | SQLAlchemy models for terminals, flows | More robust than our JSON file approach |
| **Flows** | Cron-scheduled agent sessions | Could automate recurring workflows |

### Three Orchestration Patterns

1. **Handoff** — Synchronous task transfer, caller waits for completion
   - Similar to our collaborative workflow (Gemini → Qwen → Gemini)
2. **Assign** — Delegation without waiting
   - Similar to our dispatching-parallel-agents
3. **Send Message** — Asynchronous messaging between agents
   - Not currently in our ecosystem

### Potential Applications

**Short-term** (steal ideas):
- `CAO_TERMINAL_ID` concept — More explicit than just UUID storage
- REST API approach — Could expose via `jaggers` CLI for external tools
- Database vs JSON — If workflows get complex, consider SQLite instead

**Long-term** (if ecosystem grows):
- MCP server — Replace file handoffs with proper protocol
- tmux isolation — If we need true parallel agent execution
- Flow scheduling — Automate recurring reviews/backups
